Welcome to Rossini Italian Restaurant,

I am a very close friend to the owner Fernando da Silva.
Fernando originally form portugal running an Italian restaurant in New Quay West Wales.

I have decided to base my 1st milestone project on Rossini's and try and assist my friend in thes uncertain times.

# Project Goals

I will create a site which is easy to use and give information regarding the restaurant.
Utilising information from fernando, cololour schemes and literature.

In doing so i wil try and utilise the best skills from the course notes and any other information along the way.
Keep it simple and promote his lovely cuisine.
