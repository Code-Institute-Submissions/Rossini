Most were really small just needed nudging in the right direction.

Online
 
Used google also when I got stuck using examples from stackoverflow, w3schools and slack.

Tested all ok on github and gitpod from pc to phone fully repsponsive.
But when testing physically on ipad and iphone the contact image didnt look right. On android this works perfectly ok.
